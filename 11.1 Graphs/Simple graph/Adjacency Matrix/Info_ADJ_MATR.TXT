Pros of Adjacency Matrix

The basic operations like adding an edge, removing an edge, and checking whether there is an edge from vertex i to
 vertex j are extremely time efficient, constant time operations.

If the graph is dense and the number of edges is large, an adjacency matrix should be the first choice. Even if the
graph and the adjacency matrix is sparse, we can represent it using data structures for sparse matrices.
The biggest advantage, however, comes from the use of matrices. The recent advances in hardware enable us to perform
even expensive matrix operations on the GPU.

By performing operations on the adjacent matrix, we can get important insights into the nature of the graph and the
 relationship between its vertices.


Cons of Adjacency Matrix:

The VxV space requirement of the adjacency matrix makes it a memory hog. Graphs out in the wild usually don't have too
 many connections and this is the major reason why adjacency lists are the better choice for most tasks.
While basic operations are easy, operations like inEdges and outEdges are expensive when using the adjacency matrix
 representation.
